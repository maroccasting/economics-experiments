### python and java code about UGC Feature Extraction, ML  regression and estimator
## Java code (folder: Vote_Rate_Entropy)
Java code is used basically for NLP function:
1. re-format the data repository to more compliant json format (readable by process)
2. transforming the NLP information to feature (eg.: Sentiment analysis features, PartOfSpeech properties, text tokenization and so forth 
3. mapping features to numerical matrix (MxN): M reviews , N features4. export the map
## Python code (folder: economics)
Python is used essentially for Statistical learning function. More in detail:
1. import the map and calculate descriptive statistics
2. launch the pipeline of regression function multi-model (SVM, Lasso, Ridge, RF..) and collect the results
3. estimation of votes by rating + other features
4. correlation analysis and feature ranking
5 quality-price analysis of products
6. fitting and MLE estimation of Gumbel distribution
7. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for Stochastic dominance
